## 5. Next: Twig/PHP Implementation

Would you like me to continue with the Twig/PHP implementation? I'll create:

- **PHP backend** with session management
- **Twig templates** for server-side rendering
- **MySQL database** schema for tickets
- **RESTful API** endpoints
- **Same UI components** in Twig syntax

The Vue.js implementation I've created mirrors your React app exactly with the same features and design. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with the Twig/PHP version!
